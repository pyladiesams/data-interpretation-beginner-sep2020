### Level: Beginner
### [Presentation](https://github.com/pyladiesams/data-interpretation-beginner-sep2020/blob/master/workshop/Data%20Interpretation.pdf)

## Project description
Data Interpretation is a crucial part of Data Analytics and it is quite meaningful for data wrangling, exploration, and presentation. Interested individuals who want to step in the world of data, need to develop their skills in three dimensions to be able to interpret data in a suitable manner. The three dimensions are including programming skills, statistics knowledge, and domain knowledge. In this workshop, we will focus on all those dimensions using a business case. We will use an interesting angle to look at the business problem and prepare for the story that we want to tell to the front-line decision makers.

## Setup:
Install all the dependencies using pip with the following command: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
Note: Please ensure that you navigate to the directory where the requirements.txt file is stored before running either of these commands
