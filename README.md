# An introduction to Data Interpretation and Storytelling with Python 
### Level: Beginner
### Presentation: https://github.com/pyladiesams/data-interpretation-beginner-sep2020 (Navigate the workshop folder)

## Project description
Data Interpretation is a crucial part of Data Analytics and it is quite meaningful for data wrangling, exploration, and presentation. Interested individuals who want to step in the world of data, need to develop their skills in three dimensions to be able to interpret data in a suitable manner. The three dimensions are including programming skills, statistics knowledge, and domain knowledge. In this workshop, we will focus on all those dimensions using a business case. We will use an interesting angle to look at the business problem and prepare for the story that we want to tell to the front-line decision makers.

## Setup:
Set up a Python 3 environment that can run Jupyter notebooks (Jupyter or Jupyterlab) and install the following libraries:
* pandas
* matplotlib
* numpy

The easiest way to do this is to install [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) and install the libraries in your root environment:
```conda install pandas matplotlib numpy```

If you already have a running (ana)conda environment, you can use `env.yml` to set up a separate enviroment:
```conda env create -f environment.yml```

## Requirements
* Python 3
* pandas
* matplotlib
* numpy
* jupyter or jupyterlab

## Usage
* Clone the repository
* Start jupyter(lab) and navigate to the workshop folder
